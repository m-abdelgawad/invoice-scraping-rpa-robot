# Invoice Scraping  || RPA Robot with UiPath

## Project Overview
In this project, I have developed an automation for a process that will scrape relevant data from invoices for further processing. The Robot will read through emails and download the invoices received in the form of an email attachment as a PDF. It will extract specific data and store those values in an Excel spreadsheet and a subset of values will be uploaded to the Orchestrator Queue. And finally, the robot will email the spreadsheet to me.

## Certification

This project was a milestone in my journey to study the RPA Developer With UiPath Nanodegree provided by Udacity.
